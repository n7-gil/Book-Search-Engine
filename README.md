# Book-Search-Engine

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor a fully functional website built with RESTful api into a fully functioning website that uses a GraphQl API with Apollo Server. The website is a Google Books API search engine, and my task was to enhance the performance of the application. The application also utilizes a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express server and api.
